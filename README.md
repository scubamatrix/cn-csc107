# CN-CSC107

This repo is a supplment for the CSC-107-AOLCP: Computer Programming I course for Carson-Newman University.

It is recommended that students use [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/scubamatrix/cn-csc107) to complete the assignments.

I have created a VSCode profile with the recommended extensions and workspace settings:

1. Download or clone the the GitHub repository (repo) to a folder on your machine.

2. If using zip file then unzip the compressed zip file.

3. Code > Settings > Profile > Import Profile > Select File ...

4. Browse to the folder containing the repo files on your local machine.

5. Select the `python.code-profile` file in the `vscode` folder.

You should now be ready to work on a code project.

- You should create a separate folder for your course assignments.

- Select `File > Open Folder` and then browse and select the workspace folder for your assignemnts.
