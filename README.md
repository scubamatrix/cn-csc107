# CN-CSC107

This repo is a supplement for the CSC-107-AOLCP: Computer Programming I course for Carson-Newman University.

It is recommended that students use [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/scubamatrix/cn-csc107) to complete the assignments.

I have created a VSCode profile with the recommended extensions and default workspace settings:

1. Download or clone the the GitHub repository (repo) to a folder on your machine.

2. If using zip file then unzip the compressed zip file.

3. In the vscode app, select Code > Settings > Profile > Import Profile > Select File ... vscode will usually prompt you via a sidebar within the app.

4. Browse to the folder containing the repo files on your local machine.

5. Select the `python.code-profile` file in the `vscode` folder.

You should now be ready to work on a vscode project.

- You can create a folder for your course assignments using the `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` files in this repo as a starter project. 

- Select `File > Open Folder` and then browse and select the workspace folder you created for your assignment.
